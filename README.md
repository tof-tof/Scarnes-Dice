To succeed one must score 100 points before the computer opponent. 

One scores points by rolling a die a number of times. If the die lands on 2-6 the die value as added to the current rounds score. 
If the die lands on 1, all the points scored in the current round is lost. 
One can maintain their score by holding it, which adds their current rounds score to their total score, giving the computer their turn.


The computer opponent plays by the simple strategy of re-rolling if their turn's score is <20 and their current turn score added to their overall score is <100.
The computer holds its score otherwise.
